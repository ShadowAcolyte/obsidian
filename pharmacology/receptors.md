>the component of a cell or organism that initiates the chain of events leading to the drug's observed effects
### functions
1. **determine quantitative relation between dose/concentration and physiological effect**
	- receptor affinity determines concentration of drug needed
	- receptor amount determines maximal effect
2. **responsible for selectivity of action**
	- molecular size, shape, charge of drug
3. **mediate action of pharmacologic agonists and antagonists**
# macromolecular nature
receptors were discovered *after* drugs that bind to them; advances in molecular biology made it possible to identify receptors by predicted homology to previously known receptors
##### orphan receptors:
- natural ligands are unknown
##### enzymes:
| enzyme                  | drug                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| dihydrofolate reductase | methotrexate (antineoplastic drug) |
| HMG-CoA reductase       | statins                            |
##### transport proteins:
| protein                               | drug                              |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Na/K ATPase                           | cardioactive digitalis glycosides |
| serotonin/norepinephrine transporters | antidepressants                   |
| dopamine                              | cocaine/psychoactives             |
##### structural proteins:
- [[tubulin]] protein - [[colchicine]] (anti-inflammatory agent)
